## Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good

[**SoilSpec4GG**](https://soilspectroscopy.org/) is a USDA-funded [Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics
Tools Coordinated Innovation Network NIFA Award #2020-67021-32467](https://nifa.usda.gov/press-release/nifa-invests-over-7-million-big-data-artificial-intelligence-and-other) project. It brings together soil
scientists, spectroscopists, informaticians, data scientists and
software engineers to overcome some of the current bottlenecks
preventing wider and more efficient use of soil spectroscopy. A series
of working groups will be formed to address topics including calibration
transfer, model choice, outreach & demonstration, and use of
spectroscopy to inform global carbon cycle modeling. For more info refer
to: <https://soilspectroscopy.org/>.

R tutorials and software developed to implement OSSL is available via: <https://github.com/soilspectroscopy>.

Soil spectroscopy for global good project works with other global initiatives including the **[FAO Global Soil Partnership](https://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/glosolan/en/)** and the **[IEEE P4005 Standards and Protocols for Soil Spectroscopy](https://sagroups.ieee.org/4005/)** Working Group.

## What is soil spectroscopy? 

Soil spectroscopy is the measurement of light absorption when light in the [visible, near infrared or mid 
infrared (Vis–NIR–MIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) is applied to a soil surface. The proportion 
of the incident radiation reflected by soil is sensed through Vis–NIR–MIR reflectance spectroscopy. 
These characteristic spectra (see Fig. below) can then be used to estimate numerous soil attributes including: minerals, organic compounds and water.

## Open Soil Spectral Library

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5759693.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5759693)

**Open Soil Spectral Library** (OSSL) is a suite of datasets, web-services, software and tutorials.
It includes (see also <https://github.com/soilspectroscopy>):

- A soil spectral DB (mongoDB),  
- API calibration service available from <https://api.soilspectroscopy.org>,  
- Front-end solutions: **OSSL [Engine](https://engine.soilspectroscopy.org/)** and **[Explorer](https://explorer.soilspectroscopy.org/)**,  
- An R package `ossl` with all functionality used by the API,  
- Registry of global and local calibration models (<https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/>),  
- Tutorials included in this book,  

The OSSL-DB has been prepared following the OSSL schema which is available at:

As a general rule of thumb we recommend all contributors to use the following 
general OSSL scheme to organize Soil Observations & Measurements with four main tables 
and metadata + legends organized in other tables:

```{r soil-db, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Recommended OSSL database schema.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/design_soil_om_sheme.png")
```

To access global compilation of soil legacy point data sets refer to <https://github.com/OpenGeoHub/SoilSamples> repository.
To access and use Soil Spectroscopy tools also refer to <https://soilspectroscopy.org/>.

```{r pnts-mir, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Up-to-date distribution of points with MIR scans.", out.width="100%"}

```

## OSSL mongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an Open Source noSQL DB hence fast and fully scalable and extendable 
(affordable costs for cloud solutions such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and similar). 
TensorFlow and other cutting-edge ML algorithms can be easily integrated and served through a GUI.

To access OSSL DB best use the mongoDB either through a graphical user 
interface using [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download), or by using the [mongodb via R](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mongodb-and-r-example). 
The following parameters (database credentials) allow ready only access to DB:

- Name: soilspec4gg  
- Address: api.soilspectroscopy.org  
- Database: soilspec4gg  
- Username: soilspec4gg  
- Password: soilspec4gg  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
ls <- c("mongolite", "jsonify")
new.packages <- ls[!(ls %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
x = lapply(ls, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

```{r mongodb-gui, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Accessing the OSSL DB using [MongoDB GUI](https://robomongo.org/download).", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mongodb_gui.png")
```

First, we need to specify the parameters:

```{r}
library(mongolite)
library(jsonify)
source("R/ossl_functions.R")
soilspec4gg.db = list(
  host = 'api.soilspectroscopy.org',
  name = 'soilspec4gg',
  user = 'soilspec4gg',
  pw = 'soilspec4gg'
)
soilspec4gg.db$url <- paste0(
  'mongodb://', soilspec4gg.db$user, ':', 
  soilspec4gg.db$pw, '@', 
  soilspec4gg.db$host, '/', 
  soilspec4gg.db$name, '?ssl=true'
)
```

Next, we can initiate connection:

```{r}
soilspec4gg.init()
```

and now we can query and load data directly into R, for example to get a sample from AfSIS1:

```{r}
id = "icr006475" 
soilspec.sample = soilspec4gg.samplesById(id)
dim(soilspec.sample)
```


## Target variables of interest

Soil spectral scan, through the calibration procedure, are used to determine various soil variables. 
[GLOSOLAN's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)](http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/glosolan/soil-analysis/standard-operating-procedures/en/#c763834) list four groups of soil variables of interest to international soil spectroscopy projects:

Soil chemical variables:

- pH,  
- Carbon,  
- Phosphorous,  
- Potassium,  
- Nitrogen,  
- Exchangeable cations and CEC,  
- Extractable microelements,  
- Trace and major element analyses,  
- Gypsum,  
- Electrical conductivity and total soluble salt content,  
- Soluble sulfate and chloride analysis,  
- Special analysis for peats, mineral and organic soils, agriculture and forest,  

Soil physical variables:

- Bulk density,  
- Coarse fragments,  
- Particle-size distribution,  
- Water retention curve,  
- Porosity,  
- Hydraulic conductivity function,  
- Aggregate stability,  
- Moisture content,  

Soil biological variables:

- Microbial biomass,  
- Soil Respiration,  
- Enzyme activity,  
- Microbial identification,  

Soil contaminants:

- Heavy metal elements: As, Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb and similar,  
- Other soil pollutants,  

This list is constantly updated. In the OSSL we focus on soil variables for which 
there is enough global calibration measurements to fit reasonable models. Currently, 
the largest component of the OSSL is the [USDA's KSSL](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/research/) data that list about 60 variables for which 
there is enough data to fit calibration models.
