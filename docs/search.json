    "text": "1.1 What is soil spectroscopy\nSoil spectroscopy refers to the measurement of light interaction with soil. Various methods exist to measure this interaction with the goal of understanding the mineral and organic composition of soils. The most common technique is to measure the absorption when a non-collimated flux of light from the visible and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum is applied to a soil surface. The proportion of the incident radiation reflected by the soil compared to a reference material is measured, forming the basis of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Distinct characteristic spectra can then be used to estimate various soil properties, including particle size distribution, minerals, and organic compounds. The OSSL is composed of diffuse reflectance spectra collected across the visible (Vis), near- (NIR), and mid-infrared (MIR) regions.\nWith a collection of soil spectra and corresponding soil properties measured by conventional methods, one can fit predictive models to quantitatively estimate various soil properties on new scanned soil samples. This method is cost-effective, faster, does not produce chemical residues, and is more scalable than traditional soil analysis techniques. A soil spectral library, such as the OSSL, provides the training data for building and testing predictive models, which are typically developed using machine learning or chemometric algorithms. The effectiveness of these predictive models depends significantly on how well the library represents the variability and diversity of both current and new soil samples intended for prediction.",

    "text": "1.2 Soil properties of interest\nFrom initial findings with the OSSL, on average, the MIR range appears to be the best spectral region for developing spectral prediction models, followed by VisNIR and NIR (Neospectra). This happens because the MIR contains several fundamental and resolved absorption features from mineral and organic functional groups that translate to better prediction capacity, despite challenges in the interpretation that stem from chemical heterogeneity. VisNIR and NIR spectra, in turn, are made of overtones from the fundamental vibrations of the MIR range, hence, are less sensitive to soil constituents and may result in inferior performance. In addition, we found good performance for some soil properties that may not directly affect soil spectra but can be indirectly inferred and quantified (secondary properties), such as cation exchange capacity, pH, soil contaminants, etc. However, understanding both primary and secondary components in the soil helps to better understand the factors that contribute to the improvement of spectral predictive models within the complex context of soil systems and also to select the spectral range, where they are most pronounced.\nThe contrasting methods used for determining reference values (wet chemistry) of a given soil property has been a subject of internal discussion in this project. Some global initiatives have been facing this same issue in their soil databases but there still no clear or full consensus on how to harmonize those different methods. This has been a topic of great discussion and research development at the Global Soil Partnership’s Global Soil Laboratory Network (GLOSOLAN).\nIn order to maximize transparency, for now, we have decided to produce two different levels for the OSSL database. Level 0 takes into account the original methods employed in each dataset but tries to initially fit them to two reference lists: KSSL Guidance – Laboratory Methods and Manuals and ISO standards. A copy of the KSSL procedures and coding scheme is archived in ossl-imports.\nIf a reference method does not fall in any previous method, then we create a new variable sharing at least a common property and unit. A final harmonization takes place in the OSSL Level 1, where those common properties sharing different methods are converted to a target method using some publicly available transformation rule, or in the worst scenario, they are naively binded or kept separated to produce its specific model. All the implementations are documented in the ossl-import/ossl_level0_to_level1_soillab_harmonization.csv repository.\nIn addition, GLOSOLAN’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) list four groups of soil variables of interest to international soil spectroscopy projects:\nSoil chemical variables:\n\npH,\n\nCarbon,\n\nPhosphorous,\n\nPotassium,\n\nNitrogen,\n\nExchangeable cations and CEC,\n\nExtractable microelements,\n\nTrace and major element analyses,\n\nGypsum,\n\nElectrical conductivity and total soluble salt content,\n\nSoluble sulfate and chloride analysis,\n\nSpecial analysis for peats, mineral and organic soils, agriculture and forest,\n\nSoil physical variables:\n\nBulk density,\n\nCoarse fragments,\n\nParticle-size distribution,\n\nWater retention curve,\n\nPorosity,\n\nHydraulic conductivity function,\n\nAggregate stability,\n\nMoisture content,\n\nSoil biological variables:\n\nMicrobial biomass,\n\nSoil Respiration,\n\nEnzyme activity,\n\nMicrobial identification,\n\nSoil contaminants:\n\nHeavy metal elements: As, Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb and similar,\n\nOther soil pollutants,",

The soil samples were sampled in 2009. Samples were taken from three different types of soil: arable, meadow, and forest, with 3 different depths: 0-30 cm, 30-60 cm and 60-90 cm for each location (n=45). Classical wet chemistry analyses includes texture, carbon total, carbon organic, carbon inorganic, pH, C/N ratio, and CaCO3. Only texture has complete data for all depths, the other soil properties were determined only for the 0-30 cm layer. The spectra in the MIR range were taken for all depths using a ThermoFisher Nicolet Nexus 670 with a DTGS detector, diffuse reflectance module, and gold as background reference. MIR spectra were obtained in the spectral range of 400-4000 cm-1 in duplicates. The coordinates of the sampling sites are given with lower precision.\n\n📕 Jović, B., Ćirićb, V., Kovačevića, M., Šeremešićb, S., Kordića, B. (2019).

    "text": "1.2 Estimating soil properties\nGiven that each soil spectral library that was imported into the OSSL used distinct procedures for analytically determining reference values, the incompatibility has been a subject of internal discussion in this project. Some global initiatives have been facing this same issue in their soil databases but there still no clear or full consensus on how to harmonize those different methods. This has been a topic of great discussion and research development at the Global Soil Partnership’s Global Soil Laboratory Network (GLOSOLAN).\nIn order to maximize transparency, for now, we have decided to produce two different levels for the OSSL database. Level 0 takes into account the original methods employed in each dataset but tries to initially fit them to two reference lists: KSSL Guidance – Laboratory Methods and Manuals and ISO standards. A copy of the KSSL procedures and coding scheme is archived in ossl-imports.\nIf a reference method does not fall in any previous method, then we create a new variable sharing at least a common property and unit. A final harmonization takes place in the OSSL Level 1, where those common properties sharing different methods are converted to a target method using some publicly available transformation rule, or in the worst scenario, they are naively binded or kept separated to produce its specific model. All the implementations are documented in the ossl-import/ossl_level0_to_level1_soillab_harmonization.csv repository.\nIn addition, GLOSOLAN’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) list four groups of soil variables of interest to international soil spectroscopy projects:\nSoil chemical variables:\n\npH,\n\nCarbon,\n\nPhosphorous,\n\nPotassium,\n\nNitrogen,\n\nExchangeable cations and CEC,\n\nExtractable microelements,\n\nTrace and major element analyses,\n\nGypsum,\n\nElectrical conductivity and total soluble salt content,\n\nSoluble sulfate and chloride analysis,\n\nSpecial analysis for peats, mineral and organic soils, agriculture and forest.\n\nSoil physical variables:\n\nBulk density,\n\nCoarse fragments,\n\nParticle-size distribution,\n\nWater retention curve,\n\nPorosity,\n\nHydraulic conductivity function,\n\nAggregate stability,\n\nMoisture content,\n\nSoil biological variables:\n\nMicrobial biomass,\n\nSoil Respiration,\n\nEnzyme activity,\n\nMicrobial identification,\n\nSoil contaminants:\n\nHeavy metal elements: As, Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb and similar,\n\nOther soil pollutants,",

    "text": "4.3 Database description\nThe Neospectra database follows the same specification of the OSSL for soil and site information. For the near-infrared (NIR) spectra, however, additional information is provided for scanning laboratory, scanner code, and scanning accessory.\nNIR is provided in reflectance units per wavelength, with values usually ranging between 0 and 1 as fraction percent. The spectral range imported into the OSSL falls between 1350 and 2550 nm, with an interval of 2 nm.\nOne can convert reflectance (R) values to absorbance units (A) as A = log10(1/R), or backtransform with R = 1/(10^A). Similarly, wavenumber (WN, in cm-1) can be converted to wavelength (WL, in nm) with WN = 1/(WL*10000000), or backtransform with WL = 1/(WL*10000000). The factor 10M is used to convert cm to nm.\n\n4.3.1 id.sample_local_c\n\n📚 Description: Soil sample identifier.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: 30747.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 id.scan_local_c\n\n📚 Description: Scan identifier (one average spectra per scanner).\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: NEO1_030747.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 scan.lab_utf8_txt\n\n📚 Description: Scanning laboratory.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: Woodwell.\n\n\n\n4.3.4 scan.visnir.date.begin_iso.8601_yyyy.mm.dd\n\n📚 Description: Begin date of scanning following YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601).\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: 2021-01-01.\n\n\n\n4.3.5 scan.visnir.date.end_iso.8601_yyyy.mm.dd\n\n📚 Description: Begin date of scanning following YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601).\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: 2022-12-31.\n\n\n\n4.3.6 scan.nir.model.name_utf8_txt\n\n📚 Description: NIR scanner code.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: NEO1.\n\n\n\n4.3.7 scan.nir.model.serialnumber_utf8_in\n\n📚 Description: NIR scanner serial number.\n🔢 Type: numeric.\n📖 Example: 21020033.\n\n\n\n4.3.8 scan.nir.accessory.used_utf8_txt\n\n📚 Description: Yes or No for scanning accesory.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: y.\n\n\n\n4.3.9 scan.visnir.method.preparation_any_txt\n\n📚 Description: Soil sample preparation before scanning.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: &lt;2 mm.\n\n\n\n4.3.10 scan.visnir.license.title_ascii_txt\n\n📚 Description: Dataset scans license.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: CC-BY.\n\n\n\n4.3.11 scan.visnir.license.address_idn_url\n\n📚 Description: Dataset scans license url.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.\n\n\n\n4.3.12 scan.visnir.doi_idf_url\n\n📚 Description: Digital object identifier (DOI) url of the dataset scans.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7586622.\n\n\n\n4.3.13 scan.visnir.contact.name_utf8_txt\n\n📚 Description: Dataset scans contact name.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: Jonathan Sanderman.\n\n\n\n4.3.14 scan.visnir.contact.email_ietf_txt\n\n📚 Description: Dataset scans contact email.\n🔢 Type: string.\n📖 Example: jsanderman@woodwellclimate.org.\n\n\n\n4.3.15 scan_nir.1350_ref\n\n📚 Description: Reflectance in fraction unit, first wavelength in the 1350-2550 nm range.\n🔢 Type: numeric.\n📖 Example: 0.10403320.\n\n\n\n4.3.16 scan_nir.2550_ref\n\n📚 Description: Reflectance in fraction unit, last wavelength in the 1350-2550 nm range.\n🔢 Type: numeric.\n📖 Example: 0.3622029.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

It also uses a boosting mechanism (sequential trees adjusted by weights) that allows the growth of a forest by tuning the number of committees. We haven’t used the correction of final predictions by the nearest neighbors’ influence due to the lack of this feature in the MLR3 framework.\nAs predictors, we have used the first 120 PCs of the compressed spectra (to represent about 99.99% of the original variance), a threshold that considers the trade-off between spectral representation and compression magnitude [6]. The remaining farther components were used for the representation flag, i.e., checking if a sample is underrepresented in respect of the feature space from the calibration set due to some potential spectral features that are not well characterized [7,8].\nBefore PCA compression, spectra was preprocessed with Standard Normal Variate (SNV) to reduce some of the variability caused by offset and spectral dissimiliraty, while minimizing the effects of particle size, light scattering, and multicollinearity that are known issues of diffuse reflectance [9].\nHyperparameter optimization was done with 5-fold cross-validation and a smaller subset for speeding up this operation [10]. This task was performed with a grid search of the hyperparameter space testing up to 5 configurations of Committees to find the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The final model with the best optimal hyperparameter was fitted at the end with the full train data.\nSome highly-skewed soil properties were natural-log transformed (with offset = 1, that is why we use the log1p function) to improve the prediction performance [11]. They were back-transformed only at the end after running all modeling steps, including performance estimation and the definition of the uncertainty intervals.\nFinal fitted models are listed on GitHub.",

    "text": "5.3 Uncertainty and representation flag\nThe cross-validated predictions were used to estimate the unbiased absolute error, which was employed to calibrate uncertainty estimaton models via conformal prediction.The conformal prediction is built upon past experience, i.e. the error model is calibrated using the same fine-tuned structure of the respective response model.\nNon-conformity scores of the calibration set were estimated from the predicted error with a defined confidence level of 68% to approximate one standard deviation. The prediction interval (PI) can be derived by estimating the response and error values corrected by the non-conformity score of the calibration set [13,14].\nThe main advantage of conformal prediction is that the intervals are always covered, i.e. a confidence of 68% means that the predicted interval regions may contain the observed value in at least 68% of the cases. Another big advantage of conformal prediction is that it is model agnostic and we get rid of resampling mechanisms such as bootstrapping or Monte Carlo simulation which significantly requires a huge computation time for large sample sizes.\nThe representation flag was built using the PCA model employed for compression [7,8]. Considering that only the first 120 PCs are used to decompose spectra for modeling fitting, the remaining variation from farther components are residual. The difference between the original spectra and back-transformed with the first 120 PCs made possible the calculation of the Q-statistics (sum of squared residual across the spectrum). The Q statistic of new spectra are compared against a Q critical value estimated from the calibration set with a 99% confidence level.",

    "text": "5.1 Modeling framework\nWe have used the MLR3 framework [3] for fitting machine learning models, specifically with the Cubist algorithm [4,5].\nThe R-mlr folder in the ossl-models GitHub repository contains the open-access R code used to calibrate the prediction models.\nIn summary, we have provided 5 different model types depending on the availability of samples for each soil property, which was fitted without the use of ancillary information (na code), i.e., site information or environmental layers are not used as predictors, only the spectral variations.\nThe model types are composed of two different subsets, i.e., either using the KSSL soil spectral library alone (kssl code) or the full OSSL database (ossl code), in combination with three spectral types: VisNIR (visnir code), NIR from the Neospectra instrument (nir.neospectra code), and MIR (mir code).\nspectra_type\nsubset\ngeo\nmodel_name\n\n\n\n\nmir\nkssl\nna\nmir_cubist_kssl_na_v1.2\n\n\nmir\nossl\nna\nmir_cubist_ossl_na_v1.2\n\n\nnir.neospectra\nossl\nna\nnir.neospectra_cubist_ossl_na_v1.2\n\n\nvisnir\nossl\nna\nvisnir_cubist_ossl_na_v1.2\n\n\nvisnir\nkssl\nna\nvisnir_cubist_kssl_na_v1.2\nThe machine learning algorithm Cubist (coding name cubist) takes advantage of a decision-tree splitting method but fits linear regression models at each terminal leaf. It also uses a boosting mechanism (sequential trees adjusted by weights) that allows the growth of a forest by tuning the number of committees. We haven’t used the correction of final predictions by the nearest neighbors’ influence due to the lack of this feature in the MLR3 framework.\nAs predictors, we have used the first 120 PCs of the compressed spectra (to represent about 99.99% of the original variance), a threshold that considers the trade-off between spectral representation and compression magnitude [6]. The remaining farther components were used for the representation flag, i.e., checking if a sample is underrepresented in respect of the feature space from the calibration set due to some potential spectral features that are not well characterized [7,8].\nBefore PCA compression, spectra was preprocessed with Standard Normal Variate (SNV) to reduce some of the variability caused by offset and spectral dissimiliraty, while minimizing the effects of particle size, light scattering, and multicollinearity that are known issues of diffuse reflectance [9].\nHyperparameter optimization was done with 5-fold cross-validation and a smaller subset for speeding up this operation [10]. This task was performed with a grid search of the hyperparameter space testing up to 5 configurations of Committees to find the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The final model with the best optimal hyperparameter was fitted at the end with the full train data.\nSome highly-skewed soil properties were natural-log transformed (with offset = 1, that is why we use the log1p function) to improve the prediction performance [11]. They were back-transformed only at the end after running all modeling steps, including performance estimation and the definition of the uncertainty intervals.\nFinal fitted models are listed on GitHub.",

The models fitted exclusively with the KSSL can be used when the spectra to be predicted has the same instrument manufacturer/model as the spectrometers used to build the KSSL VisNIR and MIR libraries. Also, the KSSL library must be representative for the new soil samples based both on spectral similarity and range of soil properties of interest.",

    "section": "5.3 Uncertainty and representation flag",
    "text": "5.3 Uncertainty and representation flag\nThe cross-validated predictions were used to estimate the unbiased absolute error, which was employed to calibrate uncertainty estimaton models via conformal prediction.The conformal prediction is built upon past experience, i.e. the error model is calibrated using the same fine-tuned structure of the respective response model.\nNon-conformity scores of the calibration set were estimated from the predicted error with a defined confidence level of 68% to approximate one standard deviation. The prediction interval (PI) can be derived by estimating the response and error values corrected by the non-conformity score of the calibration set [13,14].\nThe main advantage of conformal prediction is that the intervals are always covered, i.e. a confidence of 68% means that the predicted interval regions may contain the observed value in at least 68% of the cases. Another big advantage of conformal prediction is that it is model agnostic and we get rid of resampling mechanisms such as bootstrapping or Monte Carlo simulation which significantly requires a huge computation time for large sample sizes.\nThe representation flag was built using the PCA model employed for compression [7,8]. Considering that only the first 120 PCs are used to decompose spectra for modeling fitting, the remaining variation from farther components are residual. The difference between the original spectra and back-transformed with the first 120 PCs made possible the calculation of the Q-statistics (sum of squared residual across the spectrum). The Q statistic of new spectra are compared against a Q critical value estimated from the calibration set with a 99% confidence level.",
