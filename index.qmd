Welcome to the Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL) manual!

The OSSL is a public and growing dataset that is compiled by the [Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good](https://soilspectroscopy.org/) initiative.

A [peer-reviewed and open-access publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296545) is available for additional reference.

Please navigate to the different sections (left menu) to learn more about soil spectroscopy and all the available resources built by the SS4GG and the community.
