## Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good

The SS4GG was a USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)-funded Cyberinformatics Tools Coordinated Innovation Network, award [2020-67021-32467](https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1023775-fact-cin-soil-spectroscopy-for-the-global-good.html). It brought together soil scientists, data scientists and other stakeholders to overcome some of the current bottlenecks preventing a wider and more efficient use of soil spectroscopy. A series of activities addressed many topics including interoperability, machine learning, community events, and application of spectroscopy predictions for informed decision-making. For more information about the initiative, please refer to our [official webpage](https://soilspectroscopy.org/).

As the original project has ended, SS4GG keeps running and improving its resources with funding from [Woodwell Climate Research Center](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/air-quality-monitoring-to-machine-learning-fund-for-climate-solutions-awards-six-new-grants/), [OpenGeoHub](https://opengeohub.org/), and [Department of Energy’s (DOE)](https://www.llnl.gov/article/50411/lawrence-livermore-grabs-two-spots-does-energy-earthshot-program), while working to secure a new round of multiyear funding.

SS4GG also works with other global initiatives including the [FAO Global Soil Partnership](https://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/glosolan-old/soil-analysis/dry-chemistry-spectroscopy/en/) and the [IEEE P4005 - Standards and Protocols for Soil Spectroscopy](https://sagroups.ieee.org/4005/) working group.

## Open Soil Spectral Library

The Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL) is a compilation of several heterogenous and independent datasets into a common standardized source. It is available as a digital asset and web-services. The OSSL compilation allowed our team to fit generally-applicable prediction models based on spectral measurements. Several resources are built around the OSSL, which includes:

- A public soil spectral library shared through several formats [(S3, mongoDB, and API)](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/database-access.html) and [documented](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/database-description.html) in this manual;
- [API](https://api.soilspectroscopy.org/__docs__/#/) with database access and an estimation service;
- Web services facilitating user interaction: [OSSL Explorer](https://explorer.soilspectroscopy.org/) and [OSSL Engine](https://engine.soilspectroscopy.org/);
- [Open-source code on GitHub](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy) used for data compilation, analysis, and machine learning;
- [Tutorials and training materials](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/hands-on-tutorial.html).
