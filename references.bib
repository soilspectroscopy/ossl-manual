  abstract = "Soil spectroscopy is a widely used method for estimating soil
              properties that are important to environmental and agricultural
              monitoring. However, a bottleneck to its more widespread adoption
              is the need for establishing large reference datasets for
              training machine learning (ML) models, which are called soil
              spectral libraries (SSLs). Similarly, the prediction capacity of
              new samples is also subject to the number and diversity of soil
              types and conditions represented in the SSLs. To help bridge this
              gap and enable hundreds of stakeholders to collect more
              affordable soil data by leveraging a centralized open resource,
              the Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good initiative has created the
              Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL). In this paper, we describe the
              procedures for collecting and harmonizing several SSLs that are
              incorporated into the OSSL, followed by exploratory analysis and
              predictive modeling. The results of 10-fold cross-validation with
              refitting show that, in general, mid-infrared (MIR)-based models
              are significantly more accurate than visible and near-infrared
              (VisNIR) or near-infrared (NIR) models. From independent model
              evaluation, we found that Cubist comes out as the best-performing
              ML algorithm for the calibration and delivery of reliable outputs
              (prediction uncertainty and representation flag). Although many
              soil properties are well predicted, total sulfur, extractable
              sodium, and electrical conductivity performed poorly in all
              spectral regions, with some other extractable nutrients and
              physical soil properties also performing poorly in one or two
              spectral regions (VisNIR or NIR). Hence, the use of predictive
              models based solely on spectral variations has limitations. This
              study also presents and discusses several other open resources
              that were developed from the OSSL, aspects of opening data,
              current limitations, and future development. With this genuinely
              open science project, we hope that OSSL becomes a driver of the
              soil spectroscopy community to accelerate the pace of scientific
              discovery and innovation.",

               of the same low-cost commercially available handheld

               NRCS National Soil Survey Center-Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory
               (NSSC-KSSL) soil archives to represent the diversity of mineral
               soils (0-30 cm) found in the United States, while 90 samples
               were selected from Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria to represent
               available African soils in the same archive. All scanning was
               performed on dried and sieved (<2 mm) soil samples. Machine
               learning predictive models were developed for soil organic

               exchangeable potassium (Ex. K), sand, silt, and clay content

               an average of the spectral scans across devices for each sample
               and, (2) using the replicate spectral scans across devices for
               each sample. We present the internal performance of these models

               are essential to guide sustainable land management and
               production agriculture. This study aimed at evaluating the
               performance and consistency of portable handheld
               Fourier‐transform near‐infrared spectrometers and the NeoSpectra
               scanners in estimating 12 common soil physical and chemical
               properties including pH; organic carbon (OC); inorganic carbon
               (IC); total nitrogen (TN); cation exchange capacity (CEC); clay,
               silt, and sand fractions; and exchangeable potassium (K),
               phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). A diverse set
               of samples (n = 600) were retrieved from a national‐scale soil
               archive of the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory of USDA‐NRCS and
               scanned with five NeoSpectra scanners. Predictive models for the
               soil properties were developed using partial least squares
               regression (PLSR), Cubist, and memory‐based learning (MBL).
               Cubist outperformed PLSR and MBL, with the best prediction
               performance for clay, OC, and CEC (R2 > 0.7), followed by IC,
               sand, silt, and Mg (R2 > 0.6), and then pH, TN, and Ca (R2 >
               0.5). K and P were predicted somewhat poorly with R2 of 0.48 and
               0.22. All five NeoSpectra yielded comparable near‐infrared (NIR)
               spectral data and the PLSR models for the soil properties (in
               terms of model regression coefficients). However, the
               consistency assessment showed that the model performance was
               significantly decreased when the training and testing spectra
               were from different NeoSpectra scanners. It is concluded that
               NeoSpectra scanners could be rapid and cost effective for
               estimating certain soil properties, and calibration transfer
               should be considered for applications where multiple devices are
               involved and high estimation accuracy from NIR data is required.",
