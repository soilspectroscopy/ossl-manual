## Clone, add reference, submit merge request...

To add a new dataset, please follow these steps:

1.  Click on the edit button on the book homepage,\
2.  Login to Github.com and select "Start a pull-request",\
3.  Add new references to `020-dataset_list.Rmd` and save,\
4.  Commit and push and make a [pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\
5.  Once received we will check it and if you have followed the instructions closely, 
    the reference will appear in the document as soon as the code is merged with the master,\

```{r pull-request, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example of a pull request on Github.com.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/example_pull_request.jpg")
```
