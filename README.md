We have provided instructions on [Importing new datasets to OSSL](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/#importing-new-datasets-to-ossl) section.

We encourage that all datasets, including various versions, should come with a DOI. If you don't have a DOI yet, please upload and register your dataset via <https://zenodo.org> or 
similar platform. Paper DOIs are also great references.

You can use the [Neospectra database](https://zenodo.org/record/7600137) as a reference of Zenodo upload that is integrated into the OSSL.

Private datasets can be also listed and imported, however promotional materials, commercial offers and similar won't be accepted.
